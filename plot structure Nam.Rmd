This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# install dependencies and devtools
#install.packages(c("Cairo","ggplot2","gridExtra","gtable","tidyr","devtools"),dependencies=T)
```
```{r}
# load library for use
library(pophelper)
```
```{r}
cite(pophelper)
```

```{r}
try<-readQ('nam_with_pops_k5_run1_f')
```

```{r}
#plotQ(try)
```

```{r}
inds<-read.table("nam_sorted_pops.txt", header=T)
```

```{r}
head(inds)
```

```{r}
nrow(inds)
```
```{r}
inds$pop<-as.character(inds$pop)
```

```{r}
onelabset1 <- inds[,2,drop=FALSE]
```

```{r}
plotQ(try,imgtype="pdf",basesize=11,grplab=onelabset1,grplabsize=1,linesize=0.8,pointsize=4,clustercol=c("#48B098", "#91CB62", "#FFEE3B", "#FB9013", "#FF3C28"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
