Explanation of columns
id_number: position of plant in order across all plots and blocks
maternal_plant: plant id from which the seeds were collected from
population: code for source population
block: block in which plant was placed
continent: continent for source plant â€” either North America (Nam) or Europe (Eur) 
latitude: latitude of source population
longitude: longitude of source population
ft_start_date: flowering time start date quantified as days from July 1
final_height: height of plant at the end of experiment. Plants were measured after being harvested
total_brances: count of branches after harvesting
male_fitnes_estimate: male fitness was estimated by measuring the total length of all inflorescences after harvest. If inflorescences were not mature at the end of the experiment they were not counted. In cases where senescence had begun and an inflorescence had dropped from a branch, that branch was assigned the mean for the rest of the plant. 
female_fitness_estimate: female fitness was estimated as the total seed weight. A with male fitness, if seeds from a branch had already fallen off at time of harvest, that branch was assigned the mean fo the rest of the plant.
